# 📡 RFID-Based Attendance System (ESP32 + SD Card + Python)

A smart and affordable attendance system built using the **ESP32**, **RFID (RC522)**, and an **SD card** to log attendance data. This system is designed for offline use and can later be expanded to support online databases or dashboards. A Python-based backend is optionally included for local data logging and future integrations.

## 🔧 Features

- 📶 RFID card scanning via RC522 module
- 💾 Logs attendance data to SD card in CSV format
- 🧠 Optional Python backend for storing data in SQLite
- 🌐 Designed to be extended to cloud storage or web dashboards
- ⚡ Fast, reliable, and fully offline capable

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RFID-Based-Attendance-System.git
cd RFID-Based-Attendance-System
````

### 2. Hardware Setup

* **Connect RC522** and **SD Card Module** to the ESP32 via SPI.
* Power via USB or external 5V.
* Refer to the wiring diagram in `hardware/connection_diagram.png`.

### 3. Upload Firmware

* Navigate to the `firmware/` folder.
* Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
* Select **ESP32 Dev Module** as the board.
* Install required libraries:

  * `MFRC522`
  * `SD`
  * `SPI`
  * `Wire`
* Upload the code to your ESP32.

### 4. Python Logger Setup (Optional)

* Navigate to the `software/` folder.
* Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the logger script (reads serial data from ESP32):

```bash
python logger.py
```

* Make sure the correct COM port is used and matches your OS.

## 🗃️ SD Card Data Format

The system logs data in a file on the SD card named `attendance.csv` with the following format:

```
Timestamp,UID
2025-08-07 08:15:23,A1B2C3D4
2025-08-07 08:16:10,D4C3B2A1
